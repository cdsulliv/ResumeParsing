I have an excellent track record in being a dynamic team player who is always at hand to provide a supportive role to ensure that the team\s and individual student\s  goals and objectives are achieved.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0I currently have a green card status.Willing to relocate: AnywhereAuthorized to work in the US for any employerWork ExperienceCollege LecturerSouth Thames College-August 2006 to August 2015Morden, Surrey\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 As a programme leader I liaised with tutors to ensure efficient management of the programme\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Maintain the colleges M I S system (pro monitor) with student progress.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Evaluated and track learner progress and work under pressure with changing priorities\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Delivered commendable and sometimes exemplary teaching, learning and assessment sessions.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Research and developed new topics, courses and teaching materials, including online resources.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Plan, prepared and delivered teaching sessions, engaged and motivated students by using a range of appropriate teaching, learning methods and resources, that were recorded on schemes of work and lesson plans.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Differentiated between students so that they can be active in their own learning.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Designed and used a range of formative assessments and feedback strategies to support learning and progression.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Monitored punctuality, attendance, retention and achievement, and worked with other tutors and program leaders in order to improve course performance in these areas.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Carried out internal verification processes as appropriate.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Used learning technology appropriately to deliver teaching and learning, including learning outside of the classroom for example interactive whiteboard is and anti-plagiarism software\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Managed learning behaviour in and outside the  classroom in accordance with the college student\\xc2\\xa0disciplinary policy.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Participated in the implementation and evaluation of quality assurance activities for example the completion of course reviews attended internal verification standardisation meetings\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Communicated with peers, colleagues, administrators and parents to meet and exceed teaching goals.Administration OfficerGreen Park - London, OH-March 2000 to April 2006Planned and coordinated logistics and materials for board meetings, committee meetings and staff events\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Coordinated domestic and international travel arrangements, including booking flights, hotels and transport\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Answered and managed incoming and outgoing calls while recording accurate messages.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Opened and properly distributed incoming mail.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Assisted with event planning, including associated travel and logistics arrangements.Administration AssistantLondon College of Printing - Elephant & Castle - London, OH-March 1996 to October 1999London\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 To provide general office skills including photocopying, filing, receipt/distribution of post; also to receive and pass on messages accurately as required.EducationPost Graduate Certificate in EducationGreenwich University - London, OH2006Bachelor of Arts in Social ScienceWestminster University - London, OH1996"

I believe I have the skillset and energy necessary to successfully fill the position. I welcome the opportunity to specify how the post matches my qualifications and background perfectly.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0I graduated from Skidmore College in 2013 with a bachelor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s degree in Sociology and Intergroup Relations (IGR). IGR is a nationally recognized social justice program that originated at the University of Michigan in 1988 as a means of addressing racial tension; its primary goal is to support student learning and competencies around intergroup relations, conflict and social justice. Upon successfully co-facilitating a 2-credit course and completing the program, I developed the following skillsets and competencies:\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Application of pedagogical strategies in a classroom or dialogue setting\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Strong organizational and time management skills\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Development of co-facilitation techniques\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\xa2    Knowledge and self-growth around issues of social identity, power structures and privilege\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0Overall, I am more adept at co-learning, managing conflict, addressing intergroup dynamics and, most importantly, community building. In addition to those skills, conducting social research, organizing solidarity campaigns on campus, and working for Skidmore\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office of Student Diversity Programs caused me to develop stronger communication, problem-solving, and administrative skills. \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0My whole aim is to transfer these skills in a practical manner outside of an academic setting. Working within the social service field is the most fulfilling option since it directly benefits my community.

I am confident that my degree will allow me to contribute to the success of your department in Ultrasonography. I will demonstrate the commitment to serving at-risk individuals, serve as a team player, and leadership in one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self. I believe I would be a strong addition if I had the pleasure to work in this profession. My extensive coursework contains Abdominal and Small parts sonography, Vascular sonography, Ob/Gyn sonography, the use of different transducer, and clinical experiences has allowed me to gain knowledge, understanding, attention to detail, and appreciation for the art your facility exhibits and represents. My gainful knowledge in the technology world and the vast expenditure in the medical field have captured my attention to change one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life. Working in ultrasound, I have learned much about how sound is a useful and helpful way to capture images in real-time, and also be able to store these images into the PACS and DICOM network.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0I believe that my chosen degree will enable me to fulfill my desire to help others, expand my knowledge base, and to advocate for those in need. During my course of study, I am interested in many areas of development from in-utero to geriatrics, and am eager to learn about helping others overcome physical and internal illnesses. I have been fortunate enough to participate in non-profit organizations that have allowed me to gain valuable volunteer experiences such as the Asian-American Coalition for Education, and Christian Believers Meeting Church. In addition, to provide for some of my basic educational expenses, I started out working as a waiter and cashier at a restaurant, started my own online business, worked in several small and large businesses, and took on the role of management position; which enhanced my leadership qualities. Having several years in management has allowed me to gain a better understanding of the economy and how to strive and succeed. Furthermore, I attended and graduated from Mandarin Chinese School during my adolescent years, and also learned Cantonese and Taishanese from living in a Chinese household. My ability to speak Chinese has been truly beneficial. It has given me the opportunity to communicate more efficiently and fluently with other Chinese patients at the workplace, and has encouraged me to be willing to learn more about other various cultures and languages as well.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0I feel that I am an excellent candidate for the positions based on my experience in the work field - hands on experience have been the most valuable asset to my education. I am prepared to work under stressful environments and time constraints. Working in retail and the restaurant business has taught me how to efficiently multitask. These job experiences have sharpened my communication skills, and my ability to work quickly and efficiently.
