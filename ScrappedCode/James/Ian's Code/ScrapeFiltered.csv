Face perception is the most highly developed visual skill for most people, as well as neuropsychological evidence indicates there are designated receptors specialized in perceiving facial expressions in the human brain. Although the perception of emotions seems to be qualitative in composition, there are quantitative aspects that can be explored through the methodology of emotion perception research. This study explores the macro and micro levels of emotion perception, delving further into the differences and similarities between males and females in these two distinct yet related realms. As part of a within subjects design, 12 male and 10 female undergraduate students were administered both a macro and micro emotion perception test in groups differentiated by sex. The results showed that there was no differences between males and females on the macro tests, no differences between males and females on the micro tests, and no relationship between performance on the macro and micro tests.'"""
