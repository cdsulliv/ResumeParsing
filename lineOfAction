Do this by tonight (Tuesday: 12/29): 

1. the splitting script should work for both xml and text DONE!

#####################
2. split work experiences

Ask Colin about the preprocessor-- education, experience not found because of it, eg., Boise State Chronological, Austin College 2
   1. run the preprocessor on all xml files
   2. generate a new set_of_headings.txt based on the new xml files
   3. generate a new split_latest.csv


The split script fails at
1. preprocessor covered cases
2. column headings -> cannot be fixed
3. bolds used to denote something that is not heading -> cannot be fixed

check for heading and heading: -> refer Probheads in code

while preprocessing: remove empty tags: helps in work ex split!
